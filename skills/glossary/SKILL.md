  "що означає {X}". Two-level contract: repo-root CONTEXT.md holds project-wide terms,
  docs/features/{slug}/CONTEXT.md holds feature-scoped terms. Readers read both, and the
  per-feature entry wins. Lazy-bootstraps the target from a template. Examines BOTH levels
  for a conflicting entry. Asks for a one-sentence definition and the concept that people
  confuse with the term. Adds one line to ## Glossary. Skip generic tech words (HTTP, queue,
  cache), because they are not domain terms. Output: a created/edited CONTEXT.md. Runs at any
  time, with no input gate. specify, clarify, design and api read its ## Glossary as the
  canonical source of role names and domain-term names.

# Skill: glossary

This skill is a lazy utility. It fixes the meaning of a domain term in `CONTEXT.md` when the term first occurs, so that its meaning does not change across the pipeline. For each term, it records a one-sentence canonical definition. If the word is ambiguous, it also records a **NOT-reference** that names the concept that people confuse with it.

The skill runs at any time, with no upstream gate. It can process:

- one term in the middle of an interview,
- an `undefined-term` finding that `clarify` resolves during its sweep,
- a batch that `specify` gives to it.

The output goes to `specify` (role names and domain-term names) and to `design` (invariants). These skills use `## Glossary` as canonical, and it overrides each item that contradicts it.

This skill is a capture utility, not a Socratic stage. It does **not** run the shared Socratic loop or the critic. Its only shared dependency is the question text:
→ [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md)

Term definitions follow `artifact_language`. The `## Glossary` heading and the other H2s stay English. The frontmatter stays the frontmatter of the **template** (`status: Living` + `updated_at:`). Never write `artifact_language` or a different settings key into the file → [`../_shared/artifact-language.md`](../_shared/artifact-language.md).

English prose (artifacts and reports) follows ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English → [`../_shared/ste100.md`](../_shared/ste100.md). The chat, the questions and the handoff are in Ukrainian → [`../_shared/chat-language.md`](../_shared/chat-language.md).

## Owner

The person who controls the conversation, or any person who finds an ambiguity. If people do not agree about a term, the Tech Lead approves the canonical form.

## Inputs

- `<term>` — the domain word/phrase to fix. If the user does not give it, ask for it.
- (Optional) `<slug>` — the feature slug. The target is `docs/features/<slug>/CONTEXT.md`. If there is no slug, the target is the repo-root `CONTEXT.md`.
- (Optional) `pending_glossary_terms` — a batch that `specify` gives after it writes the spec. Process the terms one after the other.
- (Optional) an `undefined-term` finding from `clarify`. `clarify` invokes this skill **during its sweep**, one term at a time, when such a finding is Resolved. `clarify` never invents a meaning inline. The canonical definition goes here.
- (Optional) phrasings that an interview/brainstorm already found. Offer them as definition options. Do not ask an empty question.

## Protocol

1. **Select the target (the two-level contract).**
   - Root `CONTEXT.md` = **project-wide** terms (they have a meaning across features).
   - `docs/features/<slug>/CONTEXT.md` = **feature-scoped** terms (they have a meaning only in that feature).

   If the user gives `<slug>`, use the per-feature file. If not, use the repo-root file. A term is in exactly **one** of the two files. Never split it or copy it across levels. Readers (`specify`, `clarify`, `design`, `api`) read **both** files. If there is a conflict, the per-feature entry wins.
2. **Generic-term filter.** Reject words that name infrastructure or transport, not the business domain. Examples: HTTP, queue, cache, the datastore, the broker, a framework. Refuse with: «`<term>` — це технічне слово, а не домен-термін; його вибір належить SAD або ADR, а не глосарію». Continue only for real domain words.
3. **Bootstrap (lazy).** Run `test -f <target>`. If the file does not exist, copy [`./templates/CONTEXT.md`](./templates/CONTEXT.md) to `<target>`. If the file exists, read it.
4. **Conflict check — both levels.** Run `grep -i "^- <term>" <target>`. Also examine the file of the other level, if it exists (root `CONTEXT.md` ↔ `docs/features/<slug>/CONTEXT.md`).
   - If you find the term (at either level) with the same meaning, STOP. Report «вже є в глосарії» and the file that holds it. Never copy a term across levels.
   - If you find the term (at either level) with a different meaning, escalate through `AskUserQuestion` (text as [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md) specifies): «`<term>` вже визначено як `<existing>` у `<file>` — це те саме поняття чи інше?». If the concept is different:
     - If it is a real feature-scoped narrower meaning, put it in the per-feature file (there, readers let it win).
     - If not, propose a pair of names that removes the ambiguity (for example, a billing-scoped and a runtime-scoped variant). Fix both entries.
   - If you do not find the term at either level, continue.
5. **Ask for the canonical definition.** Use one `AskUserQuestion`: «Визнач `<term>` у цьому домені одним реченням». If interview/brainstorm phrasings are available, offer them as options. If not, use free text.
6. **Ask for the NOT-reference.** Use one `AskUserQuestion`: «З яким поняттям плутають `<term>`, щоб майбутній читач їх не змішав?». If there is no possible homonym, use `None`.
7. **Write one line.** Use `- <term> — <one-sentence definition>. NOT <confused concept + how it differs>.` If step 6 = None, use `- <term> — <definition>.`
8. **Add the line under `## Glossary`.** Read the file. Put the line in `## Glossary`. If the section is already in alphabetical order, keep that order. If not, put the line at the end. Never write existing entries again.
9. **Remove empty H2s.** On a new bootstrap, delete `## Invariants` / `## Out of scope` if they have no real content. Only `## Glossary` is mandatory. Put a real invariant or out-of-scope note in its section. Never write it as implementation detail.
10. **Structural self-check** — as [`../_shared/self-check.md`](../_shared/self-check.md) specifies. Read the target file(s) again from disk and make sure of **3 items**:
    1. The term occurs **exactly one time across the two levels together**. Use grep on root `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/features/<slug>/CONTEXT.md`. There is no duplicate and no split.
    2. The entry agrees with the format `- <term> — <definition>.` (with the optional `NOT …` end).
    3. No empty H2 sections stay.

    Fix and check again for a maximum of 2 cycles. Show each item that is not resolved.
11. **Stamp + commit + handoff.**
    - Set `updated_at: <today>` in the frontmatter.
    - Propose `context: + <term>` (or `context: + <term>, <term2>` for a batch). You can put this change into the intake/spec commit of the caller.
    - Then **emit the stage-handoff block** as [`../_shared/handoff.md`](../_shared/handoff.md) specifies (utility variant). It contains *Що я зробив* (with «самоперевірка: 3/3 пройдено»), *Перевір перед тим як продовжити* (`CONTEXT.md`) and *Що далі*: go back to your backbone stage (for example, `/sdd-emb:design <slug>`). `/clear` is optional.

## Definition of Done

- `<target>` exists and has `<term>` under `## Glossary` in the format «one-sentence canonical + optional NOT-reference».
- Each conflict with an existing entry is resolved (reported as a duplicate, or changed into different names).
- The skill refuses generic tech words. It does not store them.
- Empty H2 sections are removed on bootstrap. `## Glossary` stays.
- `updated_at` shows today. A commit is proposed.

## Anti-patterns

- **The glossary as a spec or a scratch pad.** Implementation detail («counter stored with a 1-minute TTL») belongs in the SAD/ADR, not here.
- **An empty H2 «for completeness».** If a heading has no bullets, remove it.
- **Silent edits.** Do not add a term without a confirmed definition. The author must control the glossary.
- **A batch «I'll add them later».** Record each term when it occurs. If you defer it, you lose it.
- **You store generic tech words.** HTTP, queue, the datastore name — refuse them.
- **You write the file again on a new run.** The skill reads and adds. It never overwrites the file.
- **An ambiguous term with no NOT-reference.** A homonym without «NOT …» will cause confusion in six months.

## References & template

- [`./templates/CONTEXT.md`](./templates/CONTEXT.md) — the output scaffold. Its inline comments are the contract for each section (Glossary is mandatory, Invariants/Out-of-scope are removed when empty).
- [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md) — the text style for the definition / NOT-reference / conflict questions.

## Example invocation

> **User:** «add term tenant for rate-limiting-per-user»
> **Skill:** `<slug>` is given → target `docs/features/rate-limiting-per-user/CONTEXT.md`. Generic filter: `tenant` is a domain word → continue. The file does not exist → copy the template. `grep "^- tenant"` → not found. Definition question → «a billable customer organisation owning 1+ users». NOT-reference question → «NOT user — a user is one person inside a tenant». Write `- tenant — a billable customer organisation owning 1+ users. NOT user (a user is one person inside a tenant).` → add it under `## Glossary` → remove the empty `## Invariants`/`## Out of scope` → `updated_at: 2026-05-28` → commit `context: + tenant`.
