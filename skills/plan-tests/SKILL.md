  Use to turn the acceptance criteria of a feature into a test plan before a test exists. The
  plan is a table that maps each spec.md §5 acceptance criterion to at least one test. It names
  the test levels (unit / integration / e2e / contract / load) and does not bind to a language or
  framework. It also sets the integration and data strategy. Triggers on "plan tests for {slug}",
  "test plan for {slug}", "how do we test {slug}", "test strategy for {slug}",
  "/sdd-emb:plan-tests {slug}", "план тестів для {slug}", "як тестувати {slug}", "тест-план".
  Output: docs/features/{slug}/test-plan.md (separate file for M+), or inline in spec.md for
  XS/S per the size matrix. Hard-refuse if spec.md is missing → run `specify {slug}` first.

# Skill: plan-tests

This skill turns a feature that has a spec into a **test plan**. The plan contains:

- A table that connects each acceptance criterion in `spec.md §5` to at least one named test.
- The levels of these tests (unit / integration / e2e / contract / load).
- The integration strategy (a real dependency that the suite starts and then discards).
- The approach for test data + cleanup.

The skill writes the plan *before* a test exists. The next stage, `implement`, reads this map and writes the red tests against it. It does not write them "however it seems". This file is the spine. The output scaffold is in `templates/test-plan.md`.

This skill keeps only its own machinery. The question phrasing is **shared** → [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md). The depth (inline in the spec or a separate file) follows the **size matrix** → [`../_shared/size-matrix.md`](../_shared/size-matrix.md). The skill names test *levels*, never test *tools*. `implement` finds the concrete commands in the repo. They are not hard-coded here.

Plan prose follows `artifact_language`. The `## Test plan` heading (parsed downstream), the test names and the level tokens stay English → [`../_shared/artifact-language.md`](../_shared/artifact-language.md).

English prose (artifacts and reports) follows ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English → [`../_shared/ste100.md`](../_shared/ste100.md). The chat, the questions and the handoff are in Ukrainian → [`../_shared/chat-language.md`](../_shared/chat-language.md).

## Owner

QA + the engineer who will implement the feature (co-authors). The tasks of each person:

- QA controls the level breakdown and the edge/error cases.
- The implementing engineer makes sure that each acceptance criterion has a test that can run, and that the integration strategy is correct for the repo.
- The Tech Lead approves that each acceptance criterion has a test.

## Inputs

- `<slug>` — the same feature slug that each earlier stage used.
- **Gate (hard-refuse if missing):** `docs/features/<slug>/spec.md`. Its §5 acceptance criteria are the only reason for this plan. Each criterion must map to a test. If `spec.md` is absent, STOP and point: «спершу запусти `specify <slug>` — тест-план мапить його §5 критерії прийнятності на тести».
- (Optional) `docs/features/<slug>/data-model.md`. The entity shapes tell you which test data to build and which data to seed/clean for each suite. If it is present, read it.
- (Optional) `docs/features/<slug>/sad.md` §6 sequence diagrams. Each drawn flow is a possible e2e test. Each boundary between participants is a possible contract test.
- (Optional) `docs/features/<slug>/.size` — a hint for the depth. If it is absent, use M as the default (a separate `test-plan.md` file). **Say this clearly in the handoff:** «розмір M (за замовчуванням — немає `.size`; запусти `/sdd-emb:classify-size <slug>`)».
- (Optional) `docs/domain/**/*.md` — domain-knowledge reference packs (for example, machine or format limits). If a numeric NFR has a load row or a format-compliance row, cite these packs. Do not invent a threshold.

## Protocol

1. **Gate.** Run `test -f docs/features/<slug>/spec.md`. If it fails, refuse with the pointer above. Then read §5 (the acceptance criteria: the rows of the coverage table) and §6 (the NFRs: they control the load tests). If `data-model.md` / `sad.md` §6 are present, read them.
2. **Pick the output target.** Use the size matrix:
   - **XS/S → write the plan inline in `spec.md`** as a short `## Test plan` section. A coverage table is enough. Do not make a separate file.
   - **M+ → write a separate `docs/features/<slug>/test-plan.md`** from the template.

   If `.size` is absent, confirm the target with one `AskUserQuestion` (phrasing per [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md)).
3. **Map levels — generic only.** Name the test levels from a fixed vocabulary. Never name a tool or a language:
   - **unit**: pure logic (a rule, a calculation, a validator), with no I/O.
   - **integration**: the module against a real dependency that it owns (DB, cache, queue).
   - **e2e**: a full flow from start to end. Use one for each critical user story.
   - **contract**: a boundary between two participants. This is an API shape or an event schema that the two sides agree on.
   - **load**: use it only when an NFR has a number (throughput, p95 latency).

   **If the `sad.md` frontmatter `target_surfaces` declares a UI surface** (`web-frontend` / `mobile-app` / `desktop-app`), add the frontend tiers:
   - **component**: a UI component that a test exercises in isolation.
   - **visual-regression** (web): the test compares the rendered UI with a baseline.
   - **e2e-through-UI**: the test drives the flow through the real UI, not only through the API.

   These tiers are the **"testing trophy"**. It is the dominant frontend testing vocabulary (web.dev / Kent C. Dodds). It is a vocabulary, not a mandate (→ [`../_shared/surfaces.md`](../_shared/surfaces.md)). Do not write tool names: no specific test runner, broker, visual-regression tool or load tool. `implement` finds what the repo already uses (e.g. Playwright / Storybook / a visual-diff tool).
4. **Core mapping (the contract of this skill) — the user chooses the level for each AC.** Build the AC→test table: **each acceptance criterion in §5 maps to ≥1 test.**
   - For each AC, **propose a default level** from this heuristic:
     - Pure logic/rule/validator → unit.
     - Behavior against a real dependency that the module owns → integration.
     - A full user-story flow → e2e.
     - An API/event shape between participants → contract.
     - If a UI surface is declared: a UI piece → component, and a user-facing flow → e2e-through-UI.
   - Then **confirm the level(s) with the user** through one `AskUserQuestion` (multiSelect). One AC can have tests at several levels, for example unit for the rule + e2e for the flow. Use the phrasing per [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md).
   - The choice of the user is final. Record it in the Level column of the table. `implement` reads it to write the test at the correct level. `implement` does not decide again.
   - A criterion with zero tests is the most serious anti-pattern.
   - Give each test a descriptive name from the intent of the criterion (e.g. `over-quota request is rejected`), not from a framework convention.
5. **Edge cases & error paths.** Give each error/authorization acceptance criterion its own dedicated test row. Never put it into the happy path. List the boundary and failure cases that the spec implies, as explicit rows. Examples: missing identifier, malformed input, dependency unavailable → the fallback behavior of the spec. Name the expected outcome of each row in plain words (no status numbers, no error-code strings).
   - Some ACs are correct only if a numerical or algorithmic property is true (a convergence bound, a numerical tolerance, a complexity budget). For such an AC, dispatch [`mathematic`](../../agents/mathematic.md) — `subagent_type: "sdd-emb:mathematic"` — before you write the row → [`../_shared/math-adversary.md`](../_shared/math-adversary.md). It confirms that the property is testable as the spec states it. Its answer sets the assertion of the row. In the dispatch prompt, tell it to write its report in ASD-STE100.
6. **Integration strategy — real, ephemeral dependency.** For integration tests, the default is **an ephemeral real dependency, e.g. a throwaway DB container**. The suite starts it and removes it after the run (testcontainers-style).
   - Do not mock the datastore. It is an anti-pattern. A mock that passes does not show that production passes.
   - Write the seed strategy (factories/fixtures for the data shape).
   - Write the cleanup boundary (per-test or per-suite). Without cleanup, the suite becomes flaky and blocks CI.
7. **NFR → load.** For each §6 NFR that has a number, write one concrete load scenario: the target rate, the duration, the metric and its threshold. Name the tool generically: **the load tool already in your repo, or e.g. k6 or Locust**. If no NFR has a number, mark the load section `<!-- N/A: no numeric NFR -->`. Do not invent a load test.
8. **CI placement.** Write which suites run where:
   - The fast suites (unit, contract) run on each PR.
   - The heavier suites (e2e, load) run on a schedule or before a release.

   This split is advice, not a pipeline config. `implement` and the CI of the repo own the actual wiring.
9. **Socratic walk + write.** Go through the coverage table and the strategy choices with the 4-state actions from [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md) (Accept / Fix / Save-as-OQ / Drop). On Fix, make that one row again (one round; the second answer is final). Keep the edits-log per [`../_shared/socratic-loop.md`](../_shared/socratic-loop.md). On pass, write the plan to its target (a separate file for M+, an inline `## Test plan` for XS/S).
10. **Structural self-check** — per [`../_shared/self-check.md`](../_shared/self-check.md). Read the written plan again from disk and make sure of these **6 items**:
    1. Each `spec.md` §5 AC id is in the coverage table.
    2. Each error/authorization AC has its **own dedicated row** (not put into a happy path).
    3. Each Level value ∈ the fixed vocabulary {unit, integration, e2e, contract, load, component, visual-regression, e2e-through-UI}.
    4. The plan has **zero tool names**. No runner / broker / visual-diff / load-tool name is permitted, except the single "e.g. k6 / Locust" allowance.
    5. The load section has numbers (rate + duration + metric + threshold) or the literal `<!-- N/A: no numeric NFR -->`.
    6. The plan is at the correct target for its size: an inline `## Test plan` for XS/S or route `quick`, a separate `test-plan.md` for M+.

    Fix + check again, ≤2 cycles. Show each problem that stays open.
11. **Propose commit + handoff.** Propose the commit `test-plan: <slug>`. Then **emit the stage-handoff block** per [`../_shared/handoff.md`](../_shared/handoff.md):
    - *Що я зробив* (incl. «самоперевірка: 6/6 пройдено»).
    - *Перевір перед тим як продовжити* (`test-plan.md`, or `spec.md` `## Test plan` for XS/S).
    - *Що далі* (`/clear`, then `/sdd-emb:implement <slug>`). `implement` uses this map to write the red tests.

## Definition of Done

- The plan is at the correct target for its size: a separate `docs/features/<slug>/test-plan.md` for M+, or an inline `## Test plan` section in `spec.md` for XS/S.
- **Each acceptance criterion in spec.md §5 maps to ≥1 named test.** No criterion is without a test.
- Each error / authorization criterion has its own dedicated test row. It is not put into a happy path.
- The test levels are generic (unit / integration / e2e / contract / load; + component / visual-regression / e2e-through-UI when `target_surfaces` declares a UI surface).
  - **No test-runner, broker, visual-regression or load-tool name is hard-coded.**
  - The load tool is named only as "the one in your repo, or e.g. k6 / Locust".
  - `implement` finds the UI tools.
- Integration tests use an ephemeral real dependency (a throwaway container). The seed and the cleanup boundary are written. No datastore is mocked.
- Each numeric §6 NFR has a load scenario (rate + duration + metric + threshold), or the load section is explicitly `<!-- N/A -->`.

## Anti-patterns

- **An acceptance criterion with no test.** The purpose of the map is to make §5 verifiable. A criterion without a test is not verifiable.
- **A name of a concrete tool or language**, for example a specific runner, broker or load tool. The legacy plan hard-coded **k6**. Here, load is "the tool already in your repo, or e.g. k6 / Locust", and the other levels stay generic. `implement` finds the real commands.
- **A mocked datastore.** A mock that passes does not show that production passes. For integration, use a throwaway real dependency.
- **e2e without a cleanup boundary.** Old state makes the suite flaky, and each flaky run blocks CI.
- **"100 % coverage" as the goal.** The target is the critical paths + the happy + error paths, mapped to acceptance criteria. It is not a line-count number.
- **A wishlist plan** ("would be nice to add"). A test plan is a commitment that the next stage does. It is not a backlog.
- **An invented load test without a numeric NFR.** If there is no number, write `<!-- N/A -->`. Do not invent a throughput target.
